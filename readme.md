# Grade calculator

This script calculates the GPA using the grades screen the university provides.

It takes the grade letters, assigns them the corresponding GPA, and multiplies
the grade by the number of credits for that subject.

The total is then divided by the total number of credits to get the average GPA.

The html file is supplied in pages/grades.html. The script can be modified to
calculate the GPA for a given semester or a range of semesters.
